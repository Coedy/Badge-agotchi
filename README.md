100% Vibecoded carnage by Chat GPT/Gemini/Claude. :skull:<br />
Slight manual tweaks like changing button choices, colours & positions as I've picked things up, but otherwise Gemini/Claude has just thrown stuff around until it works.

Yolo. :fearful:

I started by asking Chat GPT if this whole thing would be possible, its response changed day to day based on if I linked it the docs or not.<br />
I used Chat GPT to set up the simulator on PopOS! But I decided to not use it for the main exercise because of how many attempts that took...<br />
I took it's positivity and using Gemini got a super basic version working in the simulator.<br />
That is where I set up the repo.<br />
Lately (v0.1.0) I have been used Claude as it has made much more headway in much less time.<br />
